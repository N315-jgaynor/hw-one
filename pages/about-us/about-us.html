      USA Powerlifting, established in 1981 as the American Drug Free
      Powerlifting Association, Inc, is the leading drug-tested powerlifting
      organization in the United States.

    <p>
      Distinct from weightlifting, a sport made up of two lifts: the Snatch and
      the Clean-and-Jerk, where the weight is lifted above the head,
      powerlifting comprises three lifts: the Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift.
      Powerlifting competitions may be comprised of one, two or all three of the
      lifting disciplines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athletes are categorized by sex, age and bodyweight. Each competitor is
      allowed three attempts at each lift, the best lift in each discipline
      being added to their total. The lifter with the highest total is the
      winner. In cases where two or more lifters achieve the same total, the
      person with the lightest bodyweight wins.

      USA Powerlifting is responsible for sanctioning local and regional events
      where powerlifters can compete in hopes of qualifying for the national
      level events. USA Powerlifting sanctions several National Championships in
      all age groups, giving athletes a chance to see how they fare against
      competitors across the country. Top competitors are selected by USA
      Powerlifting to compete in the USA Powerlifting Pro Series with an
      opportunity to achieve their Pro Card.
